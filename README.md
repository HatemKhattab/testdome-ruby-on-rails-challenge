#### question_1
A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward or forward. Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored For example, is palindrome("Deleveled") should return true as character case should be ignored, resulting in "deleveled", which is a palindrome since it reads the same backward and forward.

#### question_2
Implement a group by owners function that: Accepts a hash containing the file owner name for each file name. Returns a hash containing an array of file names for each owner name, in any order For example, 

```ruby
for hash {'Input.txt' => 'Randy, 'Code.py' => 'Stan', 'output.txt' => 'Randy'}
the group_by_owners function should return {'Randy' =>['Input.txt', 'output.txt'], 'Stan' => ['Code.py']} 
```
